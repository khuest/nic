# Shadow Manifestation Layer  
*(Continuation of the Personality Report)*  

---

## Introduction  
In the Ego Layer, we explored how the first four functions drive everyday strengths and habits.  
Now we step into the **Shadow Layer** — the other four functions (positions 5–8).  

These functions are less conscious, often surfacing under stress, projection, or conflict.  
Yet, they also carry hidden resources that can be reclaimed through awareness.  

The Shadow moves through **three states**:  
- **Disowned** → Pushed away or denied; shows up indirectly.  
- **Projected** → Externalized onto others; reactivity is high.  
- **Integrating** → Recognized, admitted, and given a constructive role.
