# Shadow Manifestation Report (Continuation of Personality Report)

---

## Introduction  
In the Ego Layer, the first four functions describe conscious strengths and growth paths.  
Here, in the **Shadow Layer**, we examine the other four functions (positions 5–8 in Beebe’s model).  
These functions are less conscious and often surface under stress, projection, or conflict, but also carry hidden resources for integration.  

The Shadow passes through three states:  
- **Disowned** → pushed away or denied, showing up indirectly.  
- **Projected** → externalized onto others, reactivity is high.  
- **Integrating** → acknowledged and consciously reclaimed.
