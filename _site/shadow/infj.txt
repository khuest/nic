# Shadow Manifestation Layer  
*(Continuation of the Personality Report)*  

---

## Introduction  
In the Ego Layer, we explored how the first four functions drive everyday strengths and habits.  
Now we step into the **Shadow Layer** — the other four functions (positions 5–8).  

These functions are less conscious, often surfacing under stress, projection, or conflict.  
Yet, they also carry hidden resources that can be reclaimed through awareness.  

The Shadow moves through **three states**:  
- **Disowned** → Pushed away or denied; shows up indirectly.  
- **Projected** → Externalized onto others; reactivity is high.  
- **Integrating** → Recognized, admitted, and given a constructive role.

5. **Nemesis – Extraverted Intuition (Ne)** → Restless “what-ifs,” scattered alternatives, second-guessing.  
6. **Critic – Introverted Feeling (Fi)** → Harsh moral self-judgment; “I failed my values.”  
7. **Trickster – Extraverted Thinking (Te)** → Cornering others with rules/metrics; weaponized “objectivity.”  
8. **Demon – Introverted Sensing (Si)** → Paralyzing loops of past details; body/stress memories take over.

## Closing Integration Note  
Shadow functions are not enemies; they’re untapped balance.
