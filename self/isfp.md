# Ego Layer Template (Updated)

IaSFP – Artisan

## Overview  
The Artisan moves through life guided by a felt sense of authenticity and harmony with the present. They value creative expression, personal freedom, and the integrity of living true to themselves.  
At ease, they radiate a quiet warmth, often absorbed in art, music, or sensory experiences.

## Function Stack (Beebe’s 8 Archetypes)  
1. **Hero – Fi** – Deep moral compass and authentic value alignment.  
2. **Parent – Se** – Engaging with the physical world; here-and-now creativity.  
3. **Child – Ni** – Quiet, sometimes whimsical glimpses of symbolic meaning.  
4. **Inferior – Te** – Struggles with structured systems and external efficiency.  
5. **Nemesis – Fe** – Doubts about others’ emotional motives.  
6. **Critic – Si** – Overly rigid about past routines when stressed.  
7. **Trickster – Ne** – Playfully subverts possibilities, sometimes confusing others.  
8. **Demon – Ti** – Harsh internal critic of their own reasoning.

## Ego Stack in Daily Life (Comfort Zone)  

1. **Hero/Dominant – Fi →**  
   - Example: Choosing not to take a lucrative job because it doesn’t “feel right.”  
   - Dialogue: *“If it doesn’t align with who I am, it’s not worth it.”*  

2. **Parent/Auxiliary – Se →**  
   - Example: Crafting something beautiful out of everyday materials.  
   - Dialogue: *“This fabric has the exact texture I need—perfect.”*  

3. **Child/Tertiary – Ni →**  
   - Example: Suddenly imagining how today’s choice might ripple into the future.  
   - Dialogue: *“It’s almost like I can see where this path is leading…”*  

4. **Inferior – Te →**  
   - Example: Stressing over organizing finances or structured plans.  
   - Dialogue: *“Ugh, why is this system so complicated?”*

## Intra-Ego Dynamics  

### Hero–Child Loop  *(Beebe explicit)*  
- Fi + Ni → overly inward focus, neglecting real-world input.  
- Dialogue: *“This is deeply meaningful—I know it, even if no one else gets it.”*  

### Over-Giving Parent  *(Beebe implied)*  
- Se overstimulation, giving too much sensory energy to others.  
- Dialogue: *“Sure, I’ll help—it won’t take long…”* (burnt out later).  

### Unappreciated Parent  *(Synthesized)*  
- Se effort in art/design overlooked.  
- Dialogue: *“I put my whole heart into this, and no one noticed.”*  

### Inferior’s Fear  *(Beebe explicit)*  
- Te anxiety about being seen as incompetent in structured environments.  
- Dialogue: *“What if I can’t keep up with their systems?”*  

### Inferior Overwhelm → Child Overrun  *(Synthesized / Nardi supported)*  
- Te stress pushes them into Ni fantasies or doom-projections.  
- Dialogue: *“Maybe everything is going to collapse anyway…”*  

### Parent–Inferior Tension  *(Beebe explicit)*  
- Se loves spontaneity, Te demands rigid planning.  
- Dialogue: *“But if I plan everything, I’ll lose the spark.”*  

### Hero Inflation  *(Jung explicit / Beebe implied)*  
- Fi self-righteousness, rejecting external standards entirely.  
- Dialogue: *“You can’t tell me what’s right for me.”*  

### Parent–Child Dynamic  *(Synthesized)*  
- Se’s sensory joy feeds Ni symbolism, producing bursts of artistry.  
- Dialogue: *“This image feels like it means something deeper.”*  

### Hero–Inferior Push–Pull  *(Synthesized / Jung axis)*  
- Fi authenticity vs. Te efficiency.  
- Dialogue: *“I want to live true to myself—but I still need to pay rent.”*  

### Child Regression  *(Beebe implied)*  
- Escaping into Ni mystical visions when pressured.  
- Dialogue: *“Maybe this is all happening for a higher reason.”*  

### Triadic Spirals  *(Synthesized)*  
- Fi–Ni–Te spiral → authenticity obsession → mystical future projection → system stress.  
- Dialogue: *“If I follow my truth, the future will work out… right? But the system doesn’t support me.”*

## Everyday Integration  
The Artisan’s flow emerges in sensory artistry—design, performance, or immersive experiences. They move gracefully through life when free to follow their values and respond intuitively to the environment. Presence + authenticity define their vibe.

## Career fits due to natural cognitive talents  
- Designer (graphic, fashion, interior)  
- Musician or performing artist  
- Chef or artisan craftsman  
- Wellness/therapy professional  
- Adventure or travel creative  

---

## Note on the Unconscious  
- Fi can blind them to Te’s structure needs.  
- Ni adds depth but risks detachment if not grounded by Se.  
- Shadow functions can appear as insecurity toward others’ emotions or hyper-rigidity about the past.
