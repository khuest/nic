## ü™û The Self Layer ‚Äì *Core of Your Psyche*

<br><br>
## Why the Self?
---
The Self is the **core framework** of who we are ‚Äî the internal structure that organizes thought, feeling, and growth.  
It is not about performance or outward roles, but the **living center** that anchors your psyche.  

The Self remains when masks are set aside and outer personas shift.  
It guides Shadow work, informs choices, and allows your Persona expressions to adapt without losing balance.  

Understanding the Self is the starting point for maturity: without a stable center, any outer expression can feel ungrounded.

## The Backbone of the Model
---
This framework emphasizes three primary voices in the study of Self:

- **Carl Jung, M.D.** ‚Üí Originator of cognitive function theory (introversion, extraversion, thinking, feeling, sensing, intuition). His work remains the philosophical and psychological root.  
- **John Beebe, M.D.** ‚Üí Expanded Jung‚Äôs work into the *8-function archetype model*, mapping both conscious and shadow functions.  
- **Dario Nardi, Ph.D.** ‚Üí Neuroscientist whose EEG research provides biological evidence of cognitive functions in real-time brain activity.  

Together, they form a **tested, flexible backbone** for Self analysis ‚Äî psychological depth, archetypal framing, and neuroscientific support.

  Each card links to deeper analysis of functions, shadow expressions, and growth paths.</p>
  <p>If you already know your MBTI type, you can jump straight to your card.  
  If not, we recommend taking a reliable test such as <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test" target="_blank">16Personalities</a>.

## What About Other Models?
---
Personality theory has spawned countless systems. While valuable, many:  
- **Oversimplify** Jung‚Äôs insights into static stereotypes.  
- **Overcomplicate** without clarity, creating endless labels.  
- **Stay surface-level**, focusing on traits rather than *processes*.  

This space doesn‚Äôt reject those models ‚Äî but it anchors in Jung, Beebe, and Nardi as the most fertile ground for Self exploration.  
Other systems are like side-paths: interesting to visit, but not the core map.
