This website and its content represent a **personal synthesis** inspired by the works of Carl Jung, John Beebe, Dario Nardi, and other thinkers.  

It is **not a peer-reviewed psychological framework** or a substitute for therapy, counseling, or professional advice.  

The purpose of this project is to:
- Encourage reflection and self-discovery  
- Provide gamified tools for exploring ideas about the Self, Persona, and Shadow  
- Spark curiosity and personal growth in a playful, interactive way  

Please treat the material here as **exploratory and reflective**, not prescriptive.  
Use it as inspiration, not diagnosis.
