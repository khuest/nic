## What Will You Carry?
---
Every great hero faces the same questions:  
*What outfit will you wear?*  
*What power will you wield?*  
*Who will walk beside you?*

Carl Jung described individuation as three key encounters:  
- **Integrating the Persona** → Making outfits naturally yours.
- **Assimilating the Shadow** → Befriending what we once denied.  
- **Encountering the Anima/Animus** → Reconciling the inner Other, finding balance.  

In RE:equip, these aren’t abstract ideas —  
they become your **outfit, weapons, and companions**.  
The gear you choose shapes the journey you take.

<br>

## 👗 Persona as Outfits
---
The Persona is your cosmic wardrobe — the outfits you choose to navigate life’s scenes and express your inner Self.  

- **Vibes** shape how you move and connect.  
- **Perks** enhance your strengths.  
- **Enchantments** add personal flair.  
- **Integrating the Persona** → Making outfits naturally yours.

<br>

## ⚔️ Shadow as Weapons & Artifacts
---
The Shadow is what we reject, deny, or suppress.  
In RE:equip, these appear as **weapons, artifacts, or accessories** lying dormant in the arsenal.  

- A sword feared, yet powerful.  
- A cursed relic that tempts.  
- A hidden strength, long forgotten.  

**Assimilating the Shadow** means befriending what once was denied, learning to wield it responsibly.

<br>

## 🐉 Anima/Animus as Summons & Companions
---
The Anima/Animus is the inner Other — bridging qualities we resist yet long for.  
Here it becomes a **summoned ally, mythical creature, or mentor figure**.  

- A guide whose wisdom feels foreign.  
- A creature that challenges and protects.  
- A companion that expands your horizon.  

**Encountering the Anima/Animus** means reconciling with this Other, finding balance in its presence.

## 🎽 The Wardrobe of the Psyche
---
To RE:equip is to **step into awareness**.  
Every armor piece, weapon, and summon is part of you.  
Equipping is not escape — it is integration.
