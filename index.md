## ❓ The Questions We Ask

Why does our inner world feel as infinite as the universe itself?

What hidden forces shape the Self, the Persona, and the Shadow?

How do we navigate these realms to grow and connect?

## 💡 The Idea

This platform is a framework for exploring the vast universe within each of us.

What feels small — the inner world — reveals itself as infinite and complex when explored deeply.  

Psychology meets play: archetypes, functions, and growth become an interactive, gamified adventure.

Inspired by the works of Carl Jung, John Beebe, and Dario Nardi, it transforms exploration of Self, Persona, Shadow, Growth, and Relationships into a journey you can experience.
